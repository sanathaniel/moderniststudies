(Drafted by the Code of Conduct Subcommittee 2/2/21; reviewed and revised 2/18/21; approved by the Executive Committee March 2021)

<h3>Mission</h3>
The Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the study of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts from the later nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century. The organization aims to develop an international and interdisciplinary forum to promote exchange among scholars in this vital and rapidly changing field.

<h3>Values</h3>
The MSA supports the professional development of its members and the ongoing work of the field through free inquiry, critical examination, the sharing of multiple and varied scholarly perspectives, and a commitment to access and equity. The MSA values collaboration, cross-disciplinary connection, and openness, and it aspires to create a professional space hospitable to the diverse intellectual interests of its members.

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
In order for the MSA to fulfill its mission and enact its values of free inquiry, collaboration, openness, access, and equity, such that all members have the opportunity to reap the full benefits of belonging, the MSA calls upon its members to support these values in judgment and in action. MSA members are expected to participate in the work of the organization with integrity and the highest standards of professionalism. In particular, MSA members should not:

<ul>
		<li> exploit or discriminate against others on grounds such as race,
			ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual
			orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack
			thereof), or other group identity.</li>
		<li> sexually harass anyone they come into professional contact
			with, including students, colleagues, exhibitors, and staff
			members at partner institutions, hospitality and conference
			sites, or anywhere associated with the MSA and its
			programs.</li>
		<li> use language that is prejudicial or gratuitously
			derogatory.</li>
		<li> make prejudicial or arbitrary judgments (e.g., in evaluating
			conference proposals or grant applications) that might unfairly
			affect the academic freedom or professional development of
			anyone with whom they work. </li>
		<li> fail to disclose conflicts of interest (personal, professional,
			and commercial) as they relate to MSA programs and
			competitions.</li>
		<li> practice deceit or fraud on the academic community or the
			public, including plagiarizing the work of others in written or
			spoken discourse.</li>
		<li>This Code of Conduct applies to all forms of participation in
			the MSA community, including, but not limited to:</li>
		<ul>
			<li> messages sent via MSA communication channels, both internal
				(e.g., listservs, Slack) and external (e.g., social
				media);</li>
			<li> participation in MSA governance and the administrative
				workings of the organization;</li>
			<li> participation in virtual and in-person events convened by
				MSA (e.g., formal and informal events taking place during
				the annual conference, virtual events held over Zoom,
				off-site conference events such as graduate student
				meet-ups, etc.).</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting Violations</h3>
	
<ul>
	<li>In interactions you have through your involvement with MSA, if
			you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
			harassed, or have any other concerns or violations of the Code
			of Conduct to report, please contact the Membership and
			Elections Chair or any other member of the MSA Executive
			Committee. The Executive Committee will consider whether a
			violation of the Code of Conduct has occurred; the Executive
			Committee will then determine the appropriate consequences,
			which may include sanctions up to and including suspension of
			member privileges or termination of membership.</li>
	<li>If someone is found in violation of the Code of Conduct of one
			of MSAâ€™s affiliate organizations, then sanctions issued by
			another organization may also extend to MSA participation. The
			Executive Committee will take into consideration the process and
			judgment of our affiliate organizations. </li>
</ul>

The MSA Code of Conduct was approved by the Executive Committee in March 2021, and is lightly adapted from the Code of Conduct prepared by the Council of Editors of Learned Journals with grateful acknowledgment.
