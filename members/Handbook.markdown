<p>Presented by the MSAâ€™s Caucus for Contingent and Independent
Scholars</p>
<p>The Modernist Studies Association <em>Advocacy Handbook</em>
(available as a <a href="advocacy_handbook.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> or <a href="advocacy_handbook.html" target="_blank"
>Online</a>) presents recommendations for individuals, departments
and institutions, professional societies, and event organizers to
address the urgent need for support, advocacy, and action in the
face of rising precarity and contingency; restructuring,
retrenchment, and downsizing in the humanities in higher education;
and the casualization of academic labor.</p>
<p>This handbook was compiled by members of the Modernist Studies
Association over the course of two workshops held online on April
8th, 2022 and in person on October 28th, 2022. The workshops were
sponsored by the Caucus for Contingent and Independent Scholars.
Organizers and panelists included Emily Bloom, Kate Schnur,
Charlotte Jones, Sejal Sutaria, Megan Faragher, Erin Kappeler, Karen
Weingarten, Lisa Jong, Laura Hartmann-Villalta, and Laura Tscherry.
During the workshops, participants brainstormed short- and long-term
goals for addressing issues of contingency and precarious
employment.</p>
<p>MSA members and nonmembers alike are asked to use the guidance
provided by the handbook to commit to action that might effect
positive change against the precarity that impacts us all.</p>
