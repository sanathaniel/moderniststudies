<h1>2020-2021 Research Reports</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Melissa Dinsman</h2>
<p> I was awarded the Modernist Studies Association Research Travel
	Grant in 2019 for a project I was then calling <i>Weaponized
		Modernism</i>. I had big plans of travelling to London in the
	summer of 2020 for archive research. That trip never happened. That
	project never happened. The COVID-19 pandemic forced me to
	reevaluate what types of projects I could realistically complete. I
	wasn’t sure if the Modernist Studies Association would allow me to
	use the grant once the pandemic “ended,” and with the drying up of
	all travel funding at my institution, I knew there was no way a
	project that required me to go overseas was doable. So I changed my
	plans.</p>
<p>Luckily, MSA was exceedingly graceful and not only allowed me to use
	the travel money three years after it was granted, but also
	permitted me to use it for my new research project and to spend some
	of the monies on research-related expenses other than travel. This
	allowance has made all the difference to not just one, but two
	research projects, which will be the main materials I submit when I
	go up for Full Professor. These projects include a book on British
	women writers (Storm Jameson, Mollie Panter-Downes, Jan Struther,
	Rebecca West, and Virginia Woolf, and others) who sold World War II
	and an Anglo-American postwar geopolitical realignment to their
	readers, often through discussions of the domestic sphere. The funds
	also helped support an ongoing collaborative writing project on
	Violet Hunt and her circle of female author friends.</p>
<p>Because my institution does not have faculty research funds, and with
	COVID the ability to access our library and use Interlibrary Loan
	was extremely interrupted, MSA allowed me to spend some of my travel
	funds on books for research. This has been a game changer for my
	project on WWII British women writers. Thanks to the funding, I
	gained access to the books I needed for the remaining chapters of my
	project. I completed one of the chapters in early fall and plan to
	complete the remaining two by the end of 2023. The funds also
	enabled me to take a 2-day research trip to the Beinecke Rare Book
	and Manuscript Library at Yale University. Here, I looked at
	materials on Rebecca West’s letter exchange with the <i>New
		Yorker</i>’s Harold Ross as well as other materials pertaining
	to her writing for Americans in the 1940s. The Beinecke also
	contained materials helpful to my project on Violet Hunt. West was a
	friend of Hunt’s and part of the circle of writers she clung to in
	her final years. Within the West materials there were letters from
	Hunt, mentions of Hunt in West’s diaries, and even a picture of them
	together. The other research trip I took with this grant money was a
	day trip to the Manuscripts Division of Princeton University’s
	library. Here, I looked through letters between Hunt and Oliver
	Stoner, who was the husband of Norah Hoult. (Hoult’s book <i>There
		Were No Windows</i> is about Hunt.)</p>
<p>I am grateful that the MSA acknowledged the new post-pandemic reality
	for many scholars, especially those at institutions that don’t have
	research funding readily available for faculty. I am also grateful
	that they understood the practical reasons my project needed to
	change from what I had imagined doing in 2019. Because of this, I
	was able to make major progress on two projects that will be the
	backbone of my scholarly agenda as I seek my next major
	promotion.</p>

<h2>Melinda Cooper</h2>
<p>My project examines the ways in which mid-century Australian novelist
	Eleanor Dark mobilised the aesthetics of international modernism and
	the publishing opportunities available to her both at home and
	abroad to engage with international modernity from a
	settler-colonial context.</p>
<p>Due to the generous support of an MSA Travel Grant, I was able to
	travel to Canberra in the Australian National Territory to undertake
	archival research in the Eleanor Dark Papers at the National Library
	of Australia (NLA). I spent a week examining the correspondence
	between Dark and other prominent local and international writers and
	cultural figures from the 1920s to the 1970s. Through accessing
	these letters, I built a stronger picture of how Dark’s modernist
	aesthetics and left-leaning, liberal humanist ideas were
	communicated and received in the mid-century period.</p>
<p>Archival research also allowed me to trace some of the important
	influences on Dark’s work. I found that a number of prominent
	anthropologists wrote to Dark in response to the publication of her
	award-winning novel, <i>The Timeless Land</i> (1941). These letters
	helped me to examine the intersections between Dark’s depiction of
	Australian Indigenous cultures and interwar anthropological
	discourse – a finding which has informed by discussion of her use of
	modernist primitivism. I was also able to access many of the letters
	that Dark received from American poet Karl Shapiro. Shapiro met Dark
	when he was stationed at an Australian hospital during the Second
	World War; the pair continued to correspond while Shapiro was on
	active service in New Guinea and after his return to the United
	States. Shapiro’s letters to Dark reveal how both writers’ ideas and
	work developed as the result of this remarkable transnational
	literary friendship.</p>
<p>The research undertaken at the NLA will appear in my monograph,
		<i>Middlebrow Modernism: Eleanor Dark’s Interwar Fiction</i>,
	which is due to be published by the University of Sydney Press as
	part of the Studies in Australian Literature series in the coming
	year. This monograph will provide the first single-author study of
	Dark’s writing to be published in over four decades and represents a
	significant contribution to the field of Australian modernism.</p>
<p>I wish to thank the MSA for this invaluable support. As an early
	career researcher attempting to juggle the demands of writing with
	being a new parent, this grant has played a vital role in helping me
	to reach an important career milestone: the completion of my first
	book.</p>

	<b>Ruth Lechlitner’s poetry and the Environment</b>
</p>
<p>Ruth Lechlitner (1901-1989) is best known (if at all) for her radio
	verse drama <i>We Are The Rising Wing</i> broadcast on WOSU in
	Columbus, Ohio and published in the 1938 volume of James Laughlin’s
		<i>New Directions in Prose and Poetry</i>. At the time
	Lechlitner was clearly, with the publication of her first volume
		<i>Tomorrow’s Phoenix</i> (1937), identified with the group of
	labor-left poets who were her contemporaries. Louis Untermeyer,
	writing in the <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i> (Summer 1940) on
	“New Meanings in Contemporary American poetry” suggests that ‘In
	poetry the leading figures of a new order based on a universal moral
	sense begin with Carl Sandburg and Archibald MacLeish (. . . ) and
	embrace the younger Muriel Rukeyser, Willard Maas, James Agee,
	Elizabeth Bishop, Oscar Williams, Robert Fitzgerald, Joy Davidman,
	John Wheelwright, Ruth Lechlitner, and other warring contributors to
		<i>New Masses and Partisan Review</i>.’ Of the four women poets
	mentioned here (Bishop, Rukeyser, Davidman – who married C.S.Lewis –
	and Lechlitner) only Lechlitner fell into the footnotes of literary
	history. But her work bears comparison with these poets; Lechlitner
	is part of what Cary Nelson in <i>The Oxford Handbook of Modern and
		Contemporary American Poetry (2012)</i> terms a ‘collaborative
	critique of Depression-era capitalism and a collective call for
	revolutionary change.’</p>
<p>The MSA travel award supported essential research in the Lechlitner
	Archive at the University of Iowa Library. This rarely-visited
	archive provided some wonderful discoveries; alongside poetry
	manuscripts and first editions, Lechlitner’s notes and letters
	indicated a sustained engagement with the work of Lewis Mumford and
	his philosophy of technology and the pioneer of the ecology movement
	Murray Bookchin, and a serious interest in the genre of SF poetry. I
	was also able to read and research the manuscripts of Lechlitner’s
	unpublished documentary prose poem <i>Through a Glass Darkly</i> on
	the Sonoma State Hospital (an institution founded as the California
	Home for the Care and Training of the Feeble Minded in 1884) and her
	post-nuclear-apocalypse radio verse-drama <i>Tale of a World’s
		End</i> (broadcast in 1959).</p>
<p>As a result of my archival research I presented a paper on my
	findings at the MSA conference in Toronto entitled ‘Labour, Life and
	Cosmopolitics in Ruth Lechlitner’ and am currently working on an
	article, ‘Extinction Poetics: Ruth Lechlitner’s Apocalyptic
	Pastoral’ for a proposed cluster on <i>Reading Modernism in the
		Sixth Extinction</i> for the <i>Modernism/modernity</i> Print+
	platform. In focusing on the genre of late modernist SF poetry,
	which Lechlitner’s work exemplifies, I intend this article to offer
	a new way of reading modernism, extinction and apocalypse. Engaging
	closely with Lechlitner’s poetic I am arguing for the ongoing need
	to revise our conceptions and canons of modernism, and to
	acknowledge the way that emergent methodologies enable us to turn to
	‘extinct’ texts and regenerate their contemporary relevance. I am
	also continuing to research Lechlitner’s radio plays. Furthermore,
	given that Lechlitner remains out of print and rarely anthologised,
	and given the contemporary relevance of her work to both
	intersectional feminist and anthropocene studies, I am developing a
	project to edit and publish a critical edition of her poetry.</p>

<h2>Emily Bloom</h2>
<p>From February 10-15, I traveled to Ireland to consult the archives of
	Irish playwright Teresa Deevy. My goal was to find out how Deevy, as
	a deaf woman, composed her radio plays in the 1930s through 1950s
	and the kinds of institutional barriers she encountered. What I
	found in the archives shifted my focus slightly, but significantly,
	from Deevy as a radio writer to Deevy as a radio “listener.” The
	archives included rich correspondence detailing her visits to the
	radio studios, her reading of radio scripts, and her experience of
	observing her sisters as they listened to radio drama from their
	family home in Waterford, Ireland. While the project started out
	focused on radio institutions and accessibility, I left with a more
	nuanced understanding of Deevy as a media user who generated her own
	pathways of access.</p>
<p>I began at the University of Maynooth’s special collections where I
	was able to work through a trove of Deevy’s papers, which included
	typescripts of her radio plays, press clippings of criticism on her
	work, and personal recollections about Deevy from her nephew. From
	Maynooth, I went to the Trinity College archives in Dublin where I
	consulted twenty years of correspondence between Deevy and her close
	friend and fellow playwright Florence Hackett. Here I found some of
	the most intimate portraits of Deevy’s engagement with the radio
	medium, including an ecstatic account of her first visit to the BBC
	Belfast studio. I was also able to look at the Denis Johnston
	papers, which included the production notes for Johnston’s
	television adaptation of Deevy’s <i>The King of Spain’s
	Daughter</i>, which was produced for the BBC in 1939 before the
	television service was put on hold for the duration of the war.
	Deevy was enthusiastic about the possibilities of audio-visual
	broadcasting well before the medium was widely known outside of
	specialist circles and seemed eager for a mode of broadcasting that
	would be more inclusive of deaf viewers.</p>
<p>I took a side-trip to Limerick on February 13th where I was hosted by
	the Irish Women’s Writing Network and gave a talk at the University
	of Limerick on my work in progress. In attendance was Deevy’s
	grand-niece Jackie Deevy. I had a chance to talk with her after the
	lecture and briefly discuss the family history. She provided
	additional insights into the culture around deafness and disability
	within the Deevy household. Teresa Deevy had twelve siblings, two of
	whom were also deaf and of these two sisters, one was blind as well.
	Ms. Deevy relayed to me that all the family members knew how to use
	manual fingerspelling to communicate. After speaking with her and
	reading through the archives, I feel more convinced that previous
	critics have over-inflated claims that Deevy relied exclusively on
	lip-reading and that her deafness was incidental to her work.</p>
<p>My last day in Dublin, I met with the co-organizer of the Dublin
	Theatre of the Deaf, Lianne Quigley, and discussed the company’s
	2017 adaptation of Deevy’s <i>The King of Spain’s Daughter</i>,
	which was performed in Irish Sign Language. The Dublin Theatre of
	the Deaf’s performance was titled <i>Talk Real Fine, Just Like a
		Lady</i> and was created in collaboration with performance
	artist Amanda Coogan for the Dublin Fringe Festival. It was a loose
	adaptation—what Coogan calls an “appropriation” of the source
	material— that put Deevy’s script in conversation with issues
	affecting the Deaf in Ireland. The performance emphasized the
	relationship in Deevy’s script between a young, rebellious woman and
	an older woman circumscribing what is possible for the younger
	generation. The Dublin Theatre of the Deaf drew out this element to
	tell the story of oralism in Ireland when young Deaf women were told
	by the nuns that ran St. Mary’s School for the Deaf that they were
	not allowed to communicate by sign. This production shows the
	ongoing relevance of Deevy’s work for the Deaf community in Ireland
	and the potential of performance art to bridge the gap between
	historical plays like Deevy’s and contemporary audiences.</p>
<p>I want to thank the board of the Modernist Studies Association for
	this generous travel grant. As a contingent faculty member, I cannot
	overstate the difference it made in allowing me to pursue my
	research.</p>

<h2>Richard Cole</h2>
<p>The MSA grant supported a research trip to New York, where I gathered
	rare research materials pertaining to the U.S. Justice Department’s
	monitoring of the New Negro movement in Harlem. My original plan was
	to focus predominantly on the original criminal case files from the
	1923 legal trial of the United States of America v. Marcus Garvey.
	Unforeseen political events, however, caused me to sharpen my
	original research plans. My trip served as a good reminder that
	history is never static and sometimes the best evidence-based
	research can only occur by accounting for this fact.</p>
<p>Written correspondence with the National Archives and Records
	Administration commenced three months prior to travel. A meticulous
	list was developed to determine which physical records still exist
	nearly 100 years after the original SDNY court case. Although court
	transcripts of the legal trial’s original opening and closing
	statements were sadly discarded, either when the case was
	consolidated or moved into archival storage, over 1400 pages of the
	proceedings were on site at the federal building in lower Manhattan.
	I requested all key witness testimony and volumes related to the
	court case, as well as additional materials on the government
	surveillance of Marcus Garvey, the Black Star Line Steamship
	Corporation, and the Universal Negro Improvement Association. It was
	not without a certain amount of political irony, then, that just
	before I was scheduled to fly out to conduct research on the federal
	government that the U.S. government was swiftly shut down, throwing
	my research trip into jeopardy. On the eve of the shutdown, I
	received an apologetic message from a NARA research librarian
	indicating that my visit was in jeopardy. Federal employees would
	soon be locked out of the building until further notice and not
	permitted to access their email to confirm or cancel
	appointments.</p>
<p>Although the government shutdown was the longest in history, causing
	insurmountable financial hardship for many federal employees, the
	impact on my own research was unusually productive. My flight was
	non-refundable, which caused me to sharpen my role of
	researcher-as-detective. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black
	Culture held the only known microfiche copies of the 1923 SDNY court
	records. A week was spent digitally scanning over 1000 microfiche
	records. The process was tedious but faster and more accurate than
	handling the original documents in poor condition at NARA. The time
	saved allowed me to focus additional attention on locating
	now-declassified federal surveillance records on members of the New
	Negro movement. I probed the Schomburg’s extensive records on
	Garvey’s political rivals including Cyril Briggs, founder of the
	African Blood Brotherhood and editor of <i>The Crusader</i>. Rare
	documents were also scanned from the John Edward Bruce papers,
	Claude McKay’s writings, and the photographs, portraits, and prints
	of the UNIA movement. I recorded important street addresses while
	researching in order to tour on foot Harlem landmarks significant to
	the New Negro movement. Walking from the original location of the
	UNIA’s Liberty Hall down to the pier where the Black Star Line’s
	flagship <i>S.S. Yarmouth</i> was once moored allowed me to piece
	together and reimagine the urban physiognomy that gave rise to New
	Negro calls to make the potential for freedom visible. While many of
	the neighborhoods have been gentrified, and sliced up, segmenting
	the Harlem community into different groups, the project of archival
	recovery functions to catalogue the material history that features
	so centrally in the fiction, poetry, and art of black modernists
	from the turbulent period of the twenties.</p>
<p>I wish to express my gratitude to the MSA and its membership for this
	invaluable research opportunity. It will enable my transition from
	doctoral candidate to junior scholar, allowing me to supplement my
	dissertation with additional materials to revise it into a
	monograph, and ultimately to advance the field of black modernist
	studies in new directions</p>

<p>
	<b>The Margins of the Lyric: Gwendolyn Brooks Annotating
		Modernism</b>
</p>
<p>Gwendolyn Brooks read with pen in hand. Annotating in bold strokes,
	she lacked hesitation in pointing out where texts succeeded and
	where they did not. While it may seem to be an unexpected source,
	Brooks annotated an edition of Ezra Pound’s <i>ABC of Reading</i>
	published in 1951 and housed in Emory University’s Stuart A. Rose
	Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library. Underlining and writing
	in the margins, Brooks assessed Pound’s theories and proposed new
	interpretations of his work. Brooks’s marginalia throughout her
	library indicate that her voice as an annotator and as a poet
	developed in tandem. Ultimately, she contributes to what Sonya
	Posmentier in <i>Cultivation and Catastrophe: The Lyric Ecology of
		Modern Black Literature</i> (2017) calls “a different history of
	the lyric generated on the margins of American and European
	modernity” (4). Marginalia add another layer to interpretation of
	the lyric, particularly as they are, as Derrida put it, “parasitic
	and grafted” to the page (<i>Annotation and Its Texts</i>, Ed.
	Barney, 204). The books in Brooks’s library document her crafting of
	a critical voice, one that becomes increasingly more direct over
	time, attracting attention to what has been overlooked and why it
	matters. </p>
<p>A Modernist Studies Association Research Travel Grant supported
	travel to Brooks’s archive at the University of Illinois at
	Urbana-Champaign. Since the archive’s acquisition in 2013, the
	volumes in Brooks’s library have not been fully explored and are not
	available online. I was also able to work with Brooks’s teaching
	materials, which often address the books in her library. Preparing
	to teach poetry workshops at Columbia College, Chicago and
	subsequent courses at other institutions in the early and
	mid-sixties, Brooks read T. S. Eliot scholar Elizabeth Drew’s
		<i>Poetry: A Modern Guide to Its Understanding and
	Enjoyment</i>, Edmund Wilson’s <i>Axel’s Castle</i>, and Oscar
	Williams’s <i>Pocket Book of Modern Verse</i>, referring to each in
	her teaching notes. Williams’s and Louis Untermeyer’s <i>Modern
		American Poetry and Modern British Poetry</i> anthologies and
	David Daiches’s <i>Poetry and the Modern World</i> remain when
	Brooks drafts a more expansive recommended reading list for an
	American literature course in the early seventies, including
	Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps’s <i>Poetry of the Negro
		1746-1970</i>, James Baldwin’s <i>Nobody Knows My Name</i>, and
	Lorraine Hansberry’s <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>.</p>
<p>Taken together, Brooks’s library and teaching materials preserve the
	physicality of her engagement with modernism. As a teacher, she
	contributes to and redefines modernism’s midcentury institutional
	presence, her classes adding to those addressed in the work of
	Rachel Sagner Buurma and Laura Heffernan and Mark McGurl. Brooks’s
	pedagogical reading of modernism invites her to pose new questions
	for herself and her students. Contemplating Eliot’s <i>Waste
		Land</i>, she notes in her copy of <i>Axel’s Castle</i> that
	while the current world may exist in a state of decay, “at least it
	is not rigid.” In such a world, the lyric presents a malleable form,
	one to which Brooks and her students could bring new life.</p>

	<b>Nicholls State University</b>
</p>
<p>With the support of an MSA Research Travel Grant, I traveled to
	Reading, England, in June 2019 to complete archival research in the
	BBC Written Archives Centre on the BBC colonial service radio
	programs of the 1940s – 1960s. I examined roughly two thousand pages
	of scripts, memoranda, letters, and other documents from <i>Calling
		the West Indies, Calling the Caribbean</i>, and <i>Calling West
		Africa</i>, and collected information on a variety of radio
	shows, from the well-known <i>Caribbean Voices</i> to
	little-explored programs such as <i>Ten-Minute Talks</i>, <i>West
		Indian Diary</i>, <i>Behind the News</i>, and <i>We See
		Britain</i>. I also examined extensive archival records relating
	to the development of the BBC pamphlet <i>Going to Britain?</i>,
	published in 1959 and first conceived and produced as a series of
	radio broadcasts.</p>
<p>In my research, I identified a genre of “London stroll” broadcasts,
	in which Caribbean and West African writers engaged with traditions
	of urban <i>flânerie</i>, mapping, and cultural memory. In news
	bulletins, creative works, and personal essays, on a variety of BBC
	programs, I located dozens of texts that aimed to create a rich map
	of the English landscape for colonial audiences. Using GIS mapping
	software, I then traced the representations of England in these
	radio transmissions, highlighting the specificity of location in
	these aural “maps.” </p>
<p>To create my maps, I used QGIS, an open-source geographic information
	system mapping software. I first digitized specific scripts I
	identified during my research trip, identified sites referenced by
	the authors, and then located the coordinates of the place-names
	using Google Maps. In the resulting database table, I also tagged
	additional features: whether the writer had visited the site
	mentioned, the type of or reason for the visit, and the forms of
	transportation referenced. Finally, I created a GIS layer for each
	script, which I placed on an ordnance survey of Great Britain from
	1937 – 1961, a georeferenced historical base map archived by the
	National Library of Scotland.</p>
<p>Thus far, I have created multiple representative maps reflecting
	routes, frequency of types of site mentioned, and other factors for
	several Caribbean writers, including Andrew Salkey, George Lamming,
	and Carlisle Chang. I presented some of these findings at MSA 2019
	in Toronto, and I am currently completing an article on these three
	writers. Through the various digital landscapes I create using QGIS,
	I delineate a complex cultural politics in which metropolitan
	England is produced for colonial listeners even as its aesthetic
	properties and cultural centrality are called into question.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the Modernist Studies Association for providing
	substantial material assistance for me to complete this research
	trip. In the coming year, I anticipate digitizing a decade of
		<i>West Indian Diary</i> site references in order to consider
	how Caribbean immigrants from a variety of fields and geographic
	locations represented their experiences in Great Britain for their
	Caribbean audiences. Using digital mapping to represent the
	substantial body of archival material available for the BBC colonial
	programs will help produce a more complete accounting of the period
	and make this significant archive more accessible to a wider body of
	scholars.</p>

<h2>Lisa Mendelman</h2>
<p>
	<b>Menlo College</b>
</p>
<p>The MSA Research Travel Grant funded research for my new book
	project, on the history of modern fiction and mental health. I spent
	a week working in the archives at London’s British Psychoanalytical
	Society (BPS), the Wellcome Library, and the Freud Museum. This
	archival study centered on the transatlantic scientific discourses
	of psychopathology in the first half of the twentieth century. This
	research will generatively shape and enrich my new book, which
	explores how narrative form unsettles clinical definitions of mental
	illness. Each chapter considers an emergent psychiatric diagnosis
	and examines this model of personhood in period fiction as well as
	scientific writing. Engaging recent debates in the medical
	humanities and ongoing studies of gender, race, and disability, this
	project rethinks the cultural politics at work in biological schemas
	of health and illness and highlights the vexations of interpretive
	practices shared by the sciences and the arts.</p>
<p>My London research primarily focused on the unpublished and
	non-digitized writings of understudied British female psychoanalysts
	with diverse medical training and varied contributions to popular
	discourse. At the BPS, where I spent the majority of my time, I
	reviewed the papers of Marjorie Franklin (also a psychiatrist),
	Sylvia Payne (also a physician), Karin Stephen (also a physician and
	the sister-in-law of Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell), Joan Rivière
	(an early English translator of Freud), Susan Isaacs (also an “agony
	aunt” advice columnist who wrote under the pseudonym of Ursula
	Wise), and Marion Milner (also a best- selling writer who spent two
	years in the US, from 1927-1929). I also spent time at the Wellcome
	Library, reviewing the papers of better-known figures like Melanie
	Klein and Donald Winnicott and exploring doctors’ notes related to
	several of my diagnostic focuses. Finally, I spent a day at the
	Freud Museum reviewing materials related to the BPS’s “Controversial
	Discussions” of the 1940s, about the evolving scientific methods of
	psychoanalytic practice. Franklin, Payne, Stephen, Rivière, Isaacs,
	Milner, Klein, and Winnicott all participated in these heated and
	well-documented discussions. At the Freud Museum, I also reviewed
	the 200+ letters written to Anna Freud upon her father’s death in
	1939.</p>
<p>This fruitful archival study will allow me to diversify
	understandings of modernist-era scientific networks (the archives
	included many letters between the understudied figures and their
	famous counterparts). The research will further elucidate the uneven
	gendering and other identitarian dynamics of the standardizing
	cultures of modern mental health (Franklin was Jewish, like many
	figures in this history, and I’m considering how to address this
	through-line in the project). All of this work will help me to
	illuminate the exchanges between early twentieth- century scientific
	logic and the narratives of health and illness developing in modern
	novels. The MSA grant will thus be instrumental in helping me to
	think through our evolving efforts to interpret consciousness and
	corporeality.</p>

</p>
<p>With the generous support of an MSA Travel Grant, I was able to visit
	Dominica, in the Caribbean, to consult the National Archives and
	locate a number of sites related to Jean Rhys—a writer central to my
	new book project, <i>Writing the “Way Out”: Language, Technology,
		and Anticolonial Modernism</i>. Though Rhys’s personal papers
	are housed at the University of Tulsa, the National Archives in
	Roseau contain an extraordinary body of material relevant to her
	family history, the period of her residence on the island
	(1890-1907), and the time of her brief return (in 1936). These
	materials include records illuminating the formation of her social
	consciousness (e.g., registers of slaves and manumissions: Rhys was
	descended from a prominent slave-owning family on her mother’s
	side); the historical circumstances that inform her work (e.g., the
	1844 uprising known as the “Census Riots,” which her grandfather’s
	actions precipitated); and public opinion concerning members of her
	immediate family (e.g., newspaper articles on her father’s efforts
	to revive the plantocracy under Crown Colony rule: Crown Colony
	status deprived Dominicans of representative government in exchange
	for £15,000 for roadworks—funding intended to “open” the mountainous
	interior of the island to cultivation by means of the “Imperial
	Road”). These documents suggest the degree to which Rhys, on both
	sides of her family, was implicated in the apparatus of British
	imperialism—and the extent to which this apparatus was often a
	literal one: a form of power imposed through imperial technologies
	(e.g., roads).</p>
<p>Because many of the documents in the National Archives (especially
	nineteenth-century newspapers) are now too delicate to handle, the
	archivists created digital copies for me—a service that gave me
	permanent access to rare materials and saved me several days’ work
	on the ground. I was thus able to spend much of my time on the
	island visiting sites important to Rhys: I located her childhood
	home (now occupied by a tailor’s shop), the Botanical Gardens, the
	Public Library, and the Protestant Cemetery (where her father is
	buried) in Roseau; the ruins of the Geneva plantation (once
	belonging to her mother’s family) on the south coast, with its
	cast-iron waterwheel and crushing apparatus; the town of Massacre
	(which appears in <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> just below “Granbois”—a
	fictionalized version of her father’s estate, Amelia); the
	industrial remains of the Hampstead plantation, where Rhys stayed
	during her return journey to Dominica in 1936; the Kalinago
	Territory (the last settlement of indigenous peoples in the
	Caribbean), which figures in the story “Temps Perdi”; and the Perdu
	Temps mountain trail. I was also able to drive the sixteen extant
	miles of the Imperial Road and hike to a number of sites in the
	interior of the island, including Middleham Falls. Once a portion of
	Middleham Estate, the Falls are part of the plantation responsible
	both for the “illogical” route of the Imperial Road and its
	inevitable failure. (Consisting of mountainous terrain obviously
	uncongenial to cultivation, the estate was defunct by the First
	World War, and the Imperial Road—which had been diverted to access
	it—had failed along with it.) Given that Rhys, in her work,
	frequently aligns European imperialism with the technology used to
	subdue colonial landscapes and peoples, such traces are of double
	significance: a sign of imperial conquest <i>and</i> an index of the
	island’s natural resistance to instrumental domination. </p>
<p>I would like to express my sincere thanks to MSA for materially
	assisting my research, and especially for the timely support of my
	work in what is likely an increasingly vulnerable archive. Dominica
	was devastated by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, and though the
	National Archives survived intact, they were directly affected:
	email connectivity, for example, was only restored in November 2018.
	In light of these circumstances—and given ongoing climatic threats
	to the region—I am grateful for the funding that made it possible to
	visit the island and its archives this year.</p>

<h2>John Hoffmann</h2>
<p>With the support of Research and Travel Grant from the Modernist
	Studies Association, I conducted research at the British Film
	Institute on the films of Lotte Reiniger and Julius Pinschewer, two
	of German cinema’s most important practitioners of experimental film
	animation. This work forms part of my current book project,
		<i>Beyond the Border: Transnational Film Culture between Germany
		and Great Britain</i>, which challenges conventional film
	histories by focusing on transnational networks of “useful film”
	production in the inter- and postwar period. With studies of two
	countries whose cinema histories are typically considered
	separately, the project pursues a research program outside the
	respective national spheres of Germany and Great Britain through
	chapters on propaganda, documentary, advertising, and travel films.
	Below, I give an overview of the research I pursued at the British
	Film Institute in London.</p>
<p>Pinschewer was the pioneer of advertising films in Germany. In
	addition to establishing a nationwide distribution network for
	advertising films, he fostered experimental trick animation both in
	Germany and later in Switzerland. My research focuses on
	Pinschewer’s British films. With support from the MSA, I was able to
	travel to London to use the BFI’s extensive print collections, from
	back issues of well-known journals to more obscure trade
	publications like <i>Look and Listen</i>, in order to understand
	better Pinschewer’s place in the British film industry. I
	supplemented my readings with viewings of films only available at
	the BFI like, for example, the 1948 film <i>Willie Comes to
	Life</i>.</p>
<p>Pinschewer was an impresario, a businessman as much as a filmmaker.
	Reiniger was an animator who collaborated with some of the most
	important filmmakers in Weimar Germany. As early as 1926, the year
	Reiniger released her most important film <i>The Adventures of
		Prince Achmed</i>, we see the first points of contact between
	Reiniger and British culture. 1926 was the year Reiniger created a
	series of animated films based on the Dr. Dolittle books, which were
	written by the Englishman Hugh Lofting. My research in London
	concentrated on Reiniger’s role in British cinema after she
	emigrated to Great Britain in 1935. For example, the film
		<i>Galathea</i> was featured in a lecture series and film
	program that showcased Reiniger’s work shortly after she arrived in
	Britain. I therefore tracked down the archival history, both visual
	and textual, surrounding <i>Galathea</i>. During my research, I also
	discovered a film, previously unknown to me, by the British animator
	Peter King that was dedicated to Reiniger and her husband Peter
	Koch. Produced by the British Film Institute Experimental Film Fund
	and titled <i>13 Cantos of Hell</i>, this work reveals that Reiniger
	had students and imitators <i>within</i> Britain, thereby
	demonstrating the extent of her influence on British animators and
	the cultural landscape of the country after the war.</p>
<p>I would like to conclude by thanking the Modernist Studies
	Association and its members for supporting my research.</p>

</p>
<p>Thanks to the MSA Research Travel Grant, I was able to conduct
	research at the Victoria and Albert’s Blythe House archive (located
	in Olympia, west London). At Blythe House I examined selective
	issues of the strikingly designed trade journal, <i>International
		Textiles</i>, from 1933-1945 in order to contextualize my
	discussion of propaganda textiles during the interwar period. This
	research will inform part of my current book project, <i>Fashioning
		Bloomsbury</i>, specifically the fourth chapter titled “Wearing
	Propaganda.” This chapter examines the representation of service and
	work uniforms in two political polemics: Leonard Woolf’s <i>Quack,
		Quack</i> (1935) and Virginia Woolf’s <i>Three Guineas</i>
	(1938). Here I focus upon the uniform as exemplary of Bloomsbury’s
	distinctively modern preoccupation with materiality and its relation
	to forms of embodiment within the context of war.</p>
<p>Blythe House is one of the only archives that hold an almost complete
	set of the little-known multi-lingual journal, <i>International
		Textiles</i>, whose glossy and colorful pages look much more
	like a high-end fashion magazine than a trade publication. This
	influential trade paper was founded in Amsterdam in March 1933 by
	Jewish émigrés: businessman and writer Hans Juda; his wife Elsbeth
	(a photographer); and Bauhaus artist László Moholy-Nagy, who served
	as the journal’s art director. The magazine was initially published
	monthly in four languages (English, Dutch, French and German), and
	at the height of its success it had subscribers in ninety countries.
	In May 1940 production in Amsterdam was suspended due to the war,
	but the journal continued to be published in London with support
	from the British government and not an issue was missed during this
	period. In March 1946, just one year after the end of WWII, the
	journal was re-launched by Hans Juda as <i>The Ambassador: The
		British export Journal for Textiles and Fashions</i>, with a
	fervent nationalistic focus that sought to address the post-war
	needs of British infrastructure, export, and morale.</p>
<p>What was particularly useful for me was seeing how <i>The
		Ambassador</i> harnessed a sense of British patriotism without
	abandoning the internationalism that had fueled its values during
	its incarnation as <i>International Textiles</i>. In the issues that
	I examined, I witnessed the incredible range of the British textile
	and garment industries during the interwar period, particularly how
	they fared on the world stage. I learned that <i>International
		Textiles</i> was regarded as an asset to the British textile
	industry as well as a useful propaganda vehicle. Several of the
	articles that I unearthed, such as “New Cotton Designs Have British
	Fashion Appeal” (No. 4, 1941, p. 24) and “Creative Sights Will
	Promote British Skill” (<i>International Textiles</i>, No. 5, 1941,
	pp. 25-30), illustrated how Hans Juda used the magazine to promote
	positive publicity for Britain both at home and abroad while still
	making editorial space for world trade and culture. My archival
	research also enabled me to see how during the early 1940s the focus
	of the magazine shifted from its more explicitly international focus
	to a promotion of “British creative ability and craftsmanship” (as
	the March 1946 editorial regarding the magazine’s re-launch put
	it).</p>
<p>The invaluable research that I conducted at Blythe House will be
	useful to my overall monograph in progress, but it will be of
	particular use to my chapter on war and propaganda clothing. I am
	extremely grateful to the MSA for this support, particularly because
		<i>International Textiles</i> has not been digitized. I also
	learned that the Archive & Library Study Room at Blythe House will
	close on December 18, 2020 and all of its collections and artifacts
	will be moved to east London. This new facility, the Collections and
	Research Centre in Stratford’s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, will
	reopen in Spring/Summer 2023.</p>

<p>With the generous support of an MSA Research Grant, I was able to
	complete two research trips: to Wauseon, Ohio and to the National
	Archives in College Park, Maryland. These trips have allowed me to
	complete research on the introduction to my book, <i>Old-Fashioned
		Modernism: Masculinity and Midwestern Literature</i>, which is
	forthcoming in 2019 from Louisiana State University Press.</p>
<p><i>Old-Fashioned Modernism</i> offers a theory of rural modernity
	that is informed by national narratives of masculinity and rurality.
	By examining Midwestern literature, artwork, and material texts, it
	shows how regional modernism both opposes and absorbs the prevailing
	models of twentieth-century manhood. In so doing, it rethinks one of
	the dominant narratives of twentieth-century America: the simplistic
	opposition between the cosmopolitan city and the parochial,
	backwards countryside. In the introduction, I study a mural that
	hangs in the Wauseon Post Office. Painted by Jack J. Greitzer in
	1938, <i>Cooperative Planning and Development</i> of Wauseon was
	created as part of a New Deal initiative, the Public Works of Art
	Project (PWAP). It portrays both conflict and cooperation between
	local farmers and industrialists, featuring a farmer tending
	cabbages and three men engaged in building some kind of concrete
	structure. In the background there is a railroad depot, water tower,
	and several houses.</p>
<p>In the National Archives, I accessed the correspondence between
	Greitzer and Edward B. Rowan, Superintendent of the Section of
	Painting and Sculpture in the Treasury Department’s Public Buildings
	Branch. The National Archives file on Wauseon includes the critical
	feedback of the PWAP, Greitzer’s defense of his choices, and several
	letters of praise from Wauseon community members. I also found
	images of two sketches, the full-size cartoon, and the completed
	mural, as well as a technical questionnaire detailing the paint
	colors, canvas quality, and hanging specifications. I will cite many
	of these documents in my introduction. From the letters at the
	National Archives, I was able to determine Greitzer’s models for the
	images in the mural, including the Wauseon Water Works Pumping
	Station and Filtration Plant and the freight depot for the Detroit,
	Toledo, & Ironton Railway (DT&I).</p>
<p>When I visited Wauseon, I viewed the mural (while I have been writing
	about it, this grant allowed me to see it in person for the first
	time) and was given a tour of the post office, which was built in
	1937 with Treasury Department funding. At the public library, I did
	research on the mural and the railroad in local newspapers, and when
	I visited the Fulton County Historical Museum, I looked through
	their archives for images of the mural’s main structures. A local
	historian gave me a tour of the town, helping me find many of the
	mural’s main sites, including the former location of the DT&I depot
	and the likely location of a farm co-op. We also took a quick,
	illicit ride down the DT&I tracks.</p>

</p>
<p>With the generous support of an MSA Travel Grant, I was able to
	complete a research trip to the Women’s Library of the London School
	of Economics to examine their extensive and rare archival materials
	on prostitution and human trafficking. This research is integral to
	a book chapter I am writing on the response to white slavery (forced
	prostitution) in A.R. Orage’s <i>New Age magazine</i>. Tales of
	girls duped, drugged, and abducted to brothels circulated widely in
	Britain in the years leading up to the passage of the 1912 White
	Slave Act, as part of the international crusade against involuntary
	sex trafficking; such narratives also played a key role in women’s
	suffrage propaganda, providing a sensational rationale for
	enfranchisement. Although there was scant evidence of systematic
	entrapment of British girls into prostitution, the image of the
	white slave was a powerful tool to galvanize women for the cause.
	The <i>New Age</i> writers that I am investigating—Ibsenite actress
	Florence Farr, militant suffragette Teresa Billington-Greig,
	provocateur Beatrice Hastings, and emerging modernist Katherine
	Mansfield—express diverse views on the subject, while generally
	challenging the rhetoric of victimhood that surrounds the figure of
	the white slave. This research spotlights debates on women’s
	suffrage that were central to women’s modernity, yet remain marginal
	to the field of modernist studies; and it enriches our knowledge of
	the complex sexual politics of the period.</p>
<p>Among the LSE’s rich holdings, I examined several white slavery
	periodicals (<i>The Awakener</i>, <i>The Vigilance Record</i>, and
		<i>The Shield</i>), as well as the executive minutes and other
	materials from two Social Purity Organizations, the National
	Vigilance Association (NVA) and the Travelers’ Aid Society (TAS), in
	order to better familiarize myself with the rhetoric surrounding the
	figure of the white slave and the tropes of white slave narratives.
	I was able to locate and scan or save a wide range of white slave
	narratives (<i>The Awakener</i>, in particular, was replete with
	fiction as well as pertinent reviews), handbills warning young girls
	about the danger of solitary travel, court case summaries, and
	commentary on the White Slave Bill. I also located several published
	and unpublished responses to Billington-Greig’s highly critical
	article on the white slave panic, which will figure directly in my
	chapter. Social Purity Organizations are easy to caricature for
	their puritanical work promoting censorship, cloaking nude statues,
	and combatting “indecency” in music halls. Yet I came away with a
	more nuanced understanding of their day to day work: the NVA
	provided legal counsel to victims of sexual assault and the TSA
	assisted solitary female travelers who were genuinely in distress
	(as letters from these women and their families attest). <i>The
		Awakener</i>, likewise, is more complex than I could have
	appreciated without spending many hours browsing its pages: avidly
	pro-suffrage as well as active in the campaign against white
	slavery, its first issue featured a biting analysis of the economic
	causes of prostitution by George Bernard Shaw, which prompted
	animated discussion in the magazine’s correspondence, setting the
	tone for a magazine that did not eschew controversy. This research
	will significantly enrich my chapter on the <i>New Age</i> response
	to the white slave panic of 1912-1913. </p>

</p>
<p>The recent death of Robert Indiana (May 2018) – one of the last great
	remaining visual artists of a generation that included Robert
	Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Ellsworth Kelly – was especially
	poignant for me. For the past few years, I’ve delighted in learning
	about the late painter’s work while researching him for my
	dissertation, in which I dedicated a chapter to his 1968
	collaboration, <i>Numbers</i>, with Black Mountain poet Robert
	Creeley. Second only to his iconic “Love” painting and its many
	iterations, Indiana’s numeral works are among his defining themes.
	For him, every number had a personal resonance: the number 6, for
	instance, he often associated with his father, 8 with his mother. In
	their collaboration, Robert Creeley’s poems respond in kind. Each
	poem – a meditation on a single digit 0-9 provoked by Indiana’s
	screenprints – examines the various meanings we ascribe to these
	figures. Together in the volume, Creeley and Indiana probe the ways
	in which numbers pervade our individual and collective
	consciousness: how they become measures of our human lives.</p>
<p>Though never studied in its original form – in part because most of
	the 2500 copies now reside in special or private collections where
	access to them is limited – <i>Numbers</i> is a remarkable
	visual-verbal collaboration. Not only is it a beautifully printed
	and sumptuously colored book, but it is a deeply affective
	exploration (in both verse and print) of what might otherwise seem
	the most routine or mundane of forms. My goal in writing about the
	volume has therefore been twofold: first, to bring greater
	recognition to the project and, second, to afford a protracted
	account of its creation and message. With access to one of the
	copies from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and a few other available
	resources, I could offer a preliminary account in my dissertation.
	Missing from it, however, was vital information about how the
	collaboration came about and the relationships between its key
	players: Creeley, Indiana, and perhaps most crucially, the artist,
	designer, and sometime Indiana assistant, Bill Katz, who came up
	with the idea for the book in the first place.</p>
<p>Thanks to the MSA’s generous support, I have been able to fill in
	those gaps. With my research grant, I travelled to Stanford
	University, home of Robert Creeley’s collected papers and archive.
	While there, I was able to access dozens of letters exchanged
	between Creeley and Indiana and Creeley and Katz that shed light on
		<i>Numbers</i> generation and the artists’ sense of the project.
	The long letters I found from Katz to Creeley proved especially
	revealing, offering insight into his studio work with Indiana (a
	sometimes inscrutable artist) and displaying his relentless
	enthusiasm for <i>Numbers</i>, in particular. I also got to peruse
	Creeley’s proofs for his ten poems, a hard to find copy of <i>5
		Numbers</i> (a trade edition of the poems published by the Poets
	Press), and other project-related ephemera. The collaboration came
	to life for me in a totally new way, even though I’ve already been
	studying it for some time.</p>
<p>Most important, the research I completed at Stanford will help me
	revise my existing chapter on Numbers for my new book project:
		<i>Reckless, Beautiful Things: Contemporary American Poetry and
		the Artist’s Book</i>. Alongside <i>Numbers</i>, the book will
	feature three other contemporary poet-painter collaborations: Frank
	O’Hara and Michael Goldberg’s <i>Odes</i>, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge and
	Kiki Smith’s <i>Concordance</i>, and Anne Waldman and George
	Schneeman’s <i>Homage to Allen G</i> (based on Allen Ginsberg’s
	photographs). Fortunately, Stanford holds one of 145 folio copies of
		<i>Homage</i>, and being able to study and photograph while I
	was there will allow me to begin writing a chapter on it. The book
	aims not just to further enliven the visual-verbal relationships
	that galvanized postmodern artistic innovation but to demonstrate
	how the collaborative artist’s book after 1945, a seemingly
	peripheral form, indices major advancements in both visual art and
	poetry, including the use of serial forms, the advent of photography
	as a significant book medium, and the proliferation of concrete and
	other “anti-lyric” verse. Indeed it is “Here” in these collaborative
	works – as Creeley writes in “Three” – that “forms have
	possibility.”</p>

	<b>Black Extras and Performances of the Real</b>
</p>
<p>I applied to the MSA to support research for a new chapter of my
	manuscript <i>Cruel Modernism</i>. Pulling from fan magazines, film
	performances, and Hollywood novels, <i>Cruel Modernism</i> argues
	that celebrity served a pedagogical function, as difficult
	characters appeared alongside the rise of more traditional Hollywood
	star culture in the 1920s-1930s, thereby providing Americans
	spectacular test cases for empathy’s limits. Attending to oddball as
	well as marginal cases of celebrity (and non-celebrity) allows us to
	see how celebrity is constructed and also how certain identity
	groups are able to make only partial claims on the privileges that
	come with such spectacular subjectivity. To index celebrity’s
	pedagogical function for ethical and affective modes such as empathy
	and aversion, the book considers contested, problematic, and
	unlikely sites for audience identification across three sections:
	The Babies, The Nobodies, and The Unhappy.</p>
<p>The MSA grant supported research for a chapter in “The Nobodies”
	section that focuses on the use of black extras and supporting
	characters following the collapse of black independent film
	production after the coming of sound. In particular, I narrow in on
	filmic treatments of black singing as, on the one hand, a signifier
	of the real in plantation pictures and, on the other, as spectacle.
	To do so, I am analyzing the production history of King Vidor’s 1929
	all-black cast musical <i>Hallelujah</i> and the 1934 John
	Stahl-directed Imitation of Life, which features significant scenes
	of black vocal performance framed around the death of the black maid
	Delilah, as well as a lesser known film which also features a
	deathbed sequence—the relatively late black independent production
	Spencer William’s 1941 <i>The Blood of Jesus</i>. I am arguing that
	while mainstream (white) productions featured black vocal
	performance as alternatively realistic background detail—a kind of
	local color—or a two-dimensional spectacle, the black independent
	productions that survived into the sound era deployed song as a mode
	of exploring individual subjectivity.</p>
<p>With the MSA research travel grant, I visited two libraries to
	support research on the different reactions to these films in both
	race papers and in Hollywood industry publications. First, I visited
	the John Henrik Clarke Africana Library at Cornell, where I met with
	librarians. Together, Together, we were able to pinpoint a number of
	black periodicals with reviews and cultural commentary about white
	Hollywood’s investment in black actors and storylines. The reactions
	ranged from hopes for improved employment for African-American
	performers to complaints of stereotype. Most interesting for my
	purposes was the fact that the terms of the debate often appeared
	relative to questions of “realism.” Next, I visited the George
	Eastman house, where I was able to work with the holdings in films
	studies, including materials on posters for black cast films, and to
	tour the Moving Images department, which includes studio production
	stills I plan to use in the chapter. I am very grateful to the MSA
	for supporting this work.</p>

<p>The MSA research travel grant supported a research trip to Germany
	enabling me to complete necessary archival work for my doctoral
	dissertation. My dissertation focuses on the Ford Foundation’s
	cultural programs in Berlin between 1963-1965. It examines the
	cooperation of Ford with the German and American governments while
	focusing on the work and involvement of W.H. Auden, Ingeborg
	Bachmann, Witold Gombrowicz, and Piers Paul Read. Through
	institutional records, personal writings, and literary works, I
	explore a range of motivations for the writers’ participation and
	assess the impacts of involvement. In so doing, I establish that
	this new philanthropic patron held both economic and intellectual
	weight, shaping careers and complicating questions of how and where
	political engagement took place both physically and on the page.</p>
<p>The MSA grant helped me carry out a substantial portion of the German
	language research. During the trip I was able to visit three
	archives in Germany that hold institutional and personal records.
	The documents I reviewed provided an understanding of the early
	organization of the program along with insights into personal
	experiences. Each archive I visited proved to be valuable and held
	essential material for my dissertation./p> 
<p>The first archive I visited was the Literature Archive
	Sulzbach-Rosenberg. This archive holds the records of the Literary
	Colloquium Berlin, one of the three institutions established with
	Ford funding, and Walter Höllerer, the first director of the
	Colloquium and an important figure in mid-century German language
	literature and culture. This archive provided a wealth of insights
	into how the Ford grant was allocated for the Colloquium, how
	literary events were organized in Berlin during the program’s
	running, and how authors and writers became involved, including
	letters related to the involvement of Gombrowicz, Read, Bachmann,
	and Auden.</p>
<p>The second archive I visited was the German Literature Archive. This
	archive provided essential contextual information on the key Ford
	consultant, Shepard Stone. Stone had a long history of working with
	academics, publishers, and the press in post-WWII Germany both with
	the U.S. government and the Ford Foundation. The literature archive
	holds exchanges related to these activities, which provided
	fascinating insight into the thinking and motivations of Stone and
	Ford officials. The archive also holds records related to Auden and
	Bachmann’s publishing history and arrangements. Both series of
	records enabled me to better understand the writers’ publishing
	focus, motivations, and activities while involved in the
	program.</p>
<p>The final archive I visited was the German National Archive, which
	holds the records of the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst
	(DAAD). The DAAD cooperated with Ford during the first years of the
	Berlin project, providing administrative support for certain
	aspects. They then took over the Artists-in-Residence Program, which
	they still run today. Visiting the National Archive enabled me to
	see the records of the main administrator involved in the early
	years of the program, Peter Nestler, along with other early program
	records. These provided insight into the DAAD’s perspective and the
	challenges the organizations faced in working together. In short,
	the research trip was highly productive and provided me with a
	wealth of information to support my dissertation.</p>

<h2>Rebecca Bowler</h2>
<p>I am General Editor, with Suzanne Raitt and Claire Drewery, on the
	Edinburgh Critical Editions of the Works of May Sinclair (under
	contract). We are publishing Sinclair’s prose in themed tranches:
	‘Philosophy and Mysticism’ (2020), ‘Psychology and Genius’ (2022),
	‘Women, War and Feminism’ (2024), ‘Social Satire’ (2026) and ‘Social
	Realism’ (2028). I applied for the MSA Research Travel Grant to
	collect materials for these critical editions. The textual apparatus
	of each volume will feature a textual history of May Sinclair’s
	novels, philosophy and short fiction: the Critical Introduction
	(c.10-12,000 words) comprising a) composition history of the work,
	b) history of its reception, c) cultural contexts; the Textual
	Introduction, comprising a) history of the text, b) genesis, c)
	manuscripts, d) editions; e) table of textual variants.</p>
<p>The Kislak Center for Rare Books and Manuscripts at the University of
	Pennsylvannia holds galleys of the first editions of Sinclair’s
	novels, page proofs (with authorial emendations), typescripts,
	manuscripts and workbooks.</p>
<p>I set out to UPenn with the aim of collecting materials for the first
	tranche of publication, Philosophy and Mysticism: Collected Shorter
	Fiction Vol I (1895-1912), A Defence of Idealism (1917), Mary
	Olivier: A Life (1919), The New Idealism (1922), Arnold Waterlow: A
	Life (1924). I found that I had time to collect material for all
	subsequent tranches too. Sinclair’s fiction and her non-fiction were
	often written in tandem, and there are cross-references to be traced
	between each. The workbooks are important artefacts because they are
	where she first sketched out ideas: notes for articles or reviews
	appear in between scraps of novels and drafts of philosophical and
	political writing. I now have copies of all of the workbooks and am
	beginning to trace the cross-currents between Sinclair’s drafts of
	her fiction and her non-fiction.</p>
<p>I found that Sinclair’s philosophy was an ongoing concern to her,
	even while she was drafting novels that we have not classified as
	among her philosophical novels. Many of her workbooks contain
	sketches of four-dimensional time, often alongside sketches of the
	houses in which her family novels are set. The back pages of
	workbooks then have floor plans of ‘the family house’, a sketch of
	conceptual time, and a row of sums indicated how many pages she was
	writing per day and thus how long each novel should take to
	complete. Scraps of paper, too, included in the archive, are
	significant. A flyer from <i>The English Review</i>, asking Sinclair
	to renew her subscription, is covered with pencil notes about time
	and consciousness. An advertisement for a tailor has notes about
	psychology and psychoanalysis. The editions will publish her fiction
	and non-fiction side by side and will position Sinclair as a public
	intellectual. Consultation of her writing in different genres at
	different times, and concurrent cross-genre writing will enable us
	to position Sinclair as philosopher, psychologist, and cultural
	historian as well as novelist, and thus as an important modernist
	thinker.</p>

<p>Support from the MSA Travel Grant helped to facilitate my travel to
	South Asia in 2018 to research my doctoral dissertation on changing
	attitudes to artistic medium in post-independence Pakistan and
	pre-1971 Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan. While canvas painting
	represents the backbone of modern art in Pakistan, I examine how the
	medium remained encumbered by its colonial inheritances, its
	tendency to slide into cultural jingoism, and by its status as a
	“major” form that demands pictorial coherence and material autonomy.
	Alternatively, paper-based mediums such as printmaking, drawing, and
	miniature painting provided contiguities with South Asian folk and
	Islamic traditions, which became particularly important during the
	late-colonial period, particularly in Bengal and as I argue in my
	dissertation, during Zia ul Haq’s dictatorship in Pakistan during
	the 1980s. My research examines how artists took a decolonial
	approach to oil painting during the first decades of independence
	(1950s and 1960s) and includes case studies on how artists such as
	Iqbal Geoffrey (b. 1939) and Sadequain Naqvi (1930-1987) also
	deployed peripheral mediums such as collage and book publishing in
	their work during this period. My dissertation then traces a
	critical revaluation of oil painting during the 1980s, particularly
	among feminist artists and an emerging community of printmakers at
	the National College of Arts in Lahore, whose work set a precedent
	for the revival of Indo-Persian miniature as a contemporary form
	during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Broad multi-decade research projects such as mine still characterize
	the study of modern art in South Asia and are extremely demanding in
	terms of archival research, particularly given the scarcity and
	informality of archives available in the region. My research in
	Bangladesh was assisted by non-profit contemporary art organization
	Britto Arts Trust, which helped me meet scholars and artists
	including Syed Jehangir (b. 1935) and Murtaja Baseer (b.1932), and
	to undertake archival research on artist and pedagogue Zainul Abedin
	(1914-1976). In Pakistan I undertook archival research at the
	National College of Arts and the Punjab Library (newspaper
	collections) in Lahore, and the National Documentation Centre in
	Islamabad. Of particular value to my research were documents at the
	NCA related to teaching staff, pedagogical methods, and
	correspondences pertaining to mundane but immensely useful
	historical details such as price of oil paint in 1961 and the
	difficulties attached to importing art materials into the school
	over time. Alongside this archival research I was able to visit
	various private and public art collections in Pakistan and
	Bangladesh; to establish relationships necessary for future research
	visits; to collect and scan published works (in English, Urdu, and
	Bengali) relevant to my research; and to meet with artists included
	in my dissertation in order to obtain high quality images of their
	work and to refine my conceptual frameworks with their help and
	collaboration.</p>

<p>I was very grateful to secure a $500 MSA Travel Grant in 2018 to fund
	an archival trip to the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale
	University. I undertook this trip in January 2019.</p>
<p>Yale University holds part of Ernst Toller’s (1893-1939) archives. I
	have been fascinated by German playwright Toller’s work since
	completing my PhD in 2007. While writing my first book, <i>British
		Avant-Garde Theatre</i> (Palgrave MacMillan, 2012), I became
	increasingly interested in Toller as a transnational figure,
	particularly his remarkable influence over British theatre.
	Productions of his plays reappear frequently in British theatre
	historiography from the early ‘20s onwards; companies with explicit
	leftist political positions were particularly enamored with his
	work. His plays combine the experimental fragmentation of the German
	Expressionist movement with committed socialist politics. He was a
	fascinating figure – a short-lived President of the Bavarian Soviet
	Republic, political prisoner, poet, émigré artist, and dedicated
	fighter of fascism – and was admired by many British creatives from
	Stephen Spender to H.G. Wells, Rebecca West to Compton Mackenzie.
	His untimely death from apparent suicide in a NY hotel in 1939 was
	lamented by many.</p>
<p>After a decade of interest in Toller, I finally have space and
	opportunity to study Toller’s profound influence over British
	theatre in detail. Accordingly, I am spending the next year engaging
	with his archives and British theatre companies’ archives that
	contain material relating to productions of his plays. My MSA-funded
	trip to Yale was the first part of this research. The Yale archive
	is particularly important as it contains most of Toller’s writings
	in English and all of the material (as far as I can find) about a
	1933 production of his <i>Draw the Fires</i>, which he personally
	directed in Manchester. The prompt copy and various other
	manuscripts pertaining to <i>Draw the Fires</i> that I read during
	my trip illustrated Toller’s working methods and his fascinating
	responses to the Lord Chamberlain’s censorship. In addition, the
	archive contained reviews about his British productions unavailable
	elsewhere, prompt copies and translated versions of other plays, and
	numerous letters illustrating his impact on the British theatre
	scene. The archive also contained unexpected gifts: correspondence
	with Eleanor Roosevelt which showed his unheralded influence over
	the US response to the Spanish Civil War, for example, letters from
	Wells, and numerous articles which have not been quoted elsewhere
	detailing his political values and his theatrical processes.</p>
<p>This material will form the basis for a new chapter on Toller’s
	legacy in Britain, which begins in the ‘20s, before considering his
	continued (and entirely unresearched) influence on the contemporary
	British stage through figures such as Katie Mitchell, Mark Ravenhill
	and recent productions such as <i>Women of Aktion</i> by Bent
	Architect, which performs the meeting of Toller and Joan Littlewood
	during the production of <i>Draw the Fires</i>. This long-length
	chapter will be included in a book I am co-editing with Adrian
	Curtin entitled <i>Modernism in Contemporary Theatre: Re-imagining
		Drama, Reconsidering Influence, Replaying History</i>, which we
	hope will be published in 2021. However, this archival trip has also
	illustrated the amount of work still to be done on Toller so I hope
	to conduct future research, particularly into Toller’s important
	role in countering fascism in Spain and encouraging world leaders
	and influential figures to support the starving Spanish populace. </p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank MSA for
	supporting this work.</p>

<h2>Matthew Levay</h2>
<p>Thanks to the support of an MSA Research Travel Grant, I was able to
	visit the Rare and Manuscript Collections at the Cornell University
	Library in order to examine a host of materials from the Wyndham
	Lewis Collection, particularly those notes, manuscripts, and letters
	related to Lewis’s work on what became <i>The Human Age</i> trilogy.
	That work forms the center of a chapter on Lewis in my new book
	project, on modernism and the novel series. In this book, I argue
	that the form of the novel series, typically understood in
	commercial rather than formal terms, afforded a range of
	twentieth-century authors an opportunity to manipulate readers’
	expectations and experiences of characterization, plot, and
	narrative time in ways that powerfully shaped modernism’s
	experimental aesthetics. The book is thus an attempt to position the
	novel series more firmly within the inventory of modernist forms,
	and to demonstrate how seriality functions as a means of extending
	narratives past their apparent endpoints in order to produce new
	understandings of character, setting, and temporality within an
	extended and extensive plot (or, in some cases, within a work that
	seems not to value plot at all). Moreover, I also explore the
	commercial benefits and complications of modernist novel series,
	since seriality is at once a formal phenomenon manifested through a
	connected set of works and the material result of a set of
	publishing practices that audiences receive in specific ways. </p>
<p>Like so many trips to the archives, this particular visit reminded me
	that the documents that prove most absorbing are often those one
	least expects. After examining Lewis’s notes for and drafts of
		<i>The Childermass</i>, <i>Monstre Gai</i>, and <i>Malign
		Fiesta</i>, as well as the opening chapters Lewis drafted for
	the abandoned Trial of Man (the proposed fourth volume of <i>The
		Human Age</i>), I quickly became engrossed in Lewis’s
	correspondence with D.G. Bridson, the Assistant Head of Features for
	the BBC, with whom Lewis adapted The Childermass for the Third
	Programme in 1951, and in the materials produced for and around that
	adaptation and those of Lewis’s novels that followed (including
	audience reports, drafts of dialogue inserted into the radio
	adaptations, and queries about censorship, among other things). The
	radio version of The Childermass is what prompted the BBC to support
	Lewis’s revival of The Human Age in the 1950s, many years after
	Lewis had dropped his plans (and violated the terms of his contract
	with publisher Chatto and Windus) for writing these projected
	sequels. In his exchanges with Bridson and editor J. Alan White at
	Methuen, one sees Lewis thinking through serial form across multiple
	media, and considering how the serial affordances of fiction might
	inform those of radio, and vice versa. Indeed, he adapts <i>Monstre
		Gai</i> and <i>Malign Fiesta</i> for radio at the same time that
	he writes them as novels, so Lewis’s understanding of his series is,
	by nature of that dual effort, bound up in the specificities of each
	medium. What this means for my chapter is that any discussion of
		<i>The Human Age</i> and seriality must speak to both the
	published novels and the radio broadcasts, and the material
	available in Cornell’s collections provides ample evidence of how
	both sets of works were developed, produced, revised, and
	received.</p>
<p>As my time in Ithaca demonstrates, even a short period of archival
	work can produce immense benefits for one’s research, and I am
	grateful to the MSA for the support of this Research Travel Grant,
	which enabled me to shape my thinking and writing on Lewis in ways
	that will continue to benefit me in the short and the long term. </p>

<p>The MSA travel award supported research for my book project “A Queer
	Progress: The <i>Naturalization</i> of Christopher Isherwood.” The
	project investigates the diasporic journey of the queer British
	writer Christopher Isherwood, known best for <i>Goodbye to
		Berlin</i> and <i>A Single Man</i>, as he transits from
	privileged positions of class, education, and birthright, first, to
	the demimonde of a tumultuous 1930s’ Berlin, and, thereafter in
	1939, to America. There, on the brink of WWII, assailed in England
	for desertion, he settles in Los Angeles to become a naturalized
	citizen in 1946. Isherwood’s naturalization occurs in the fraught
	period of both Red and Lavender scares and alongside the emergence
	of a distinct homophile community, viz. The Mattachine Society and
	One, Incorporated. One goal of the project is to gauge how Isherwood
	navigated the scrutiny of the former and related to the latter in
	order to evaluate the impact these opposing forces might have
	exercised on his writing.</p>
<p>Earlier research conducted at The Huntington Library and at USC’s ONE
	National Gay and Lesbian Archive shows Isherwood’s initial interest
	in the 1950s of the burgeoning Los Angeles gay community but with no
	certain commitment. His diaries, prolific on many issues, are
	virtually silent on any affiliation. Yet two decades later, ONE’s
	archive documents Isherwood’s subsequent activism and, in the 1980s,
	hail him as a respected pioneer, advanced partly by the publication
	of his frank 1976 memoir <i>Christopher and his Kind</i>. The
	question I wished to answer was what commitment if any did Isherwood
	have with these emergent homophile organizations.</p>
<p>With the generous help of the MSA award, I researched materials
	archived at the New York Public Library’s International Gay Center
	Records, 1974-1989, and International Gay Information Center
	Collection, 1951-1994. Crucial were historian John D’Emilio’s
	invaluable taped interviews of the 1970s and 1980s with the
	principals of the underground network that would become the vanguard
	for the gay community on the West Coast and beyond: The Mattachine
	Society and One, Incorporated. What emerges is the complexity of
	being gay and leftist in post-war L.A. D’Emilio’s interviews reveal
	the considerable bravery such organizers as Harry Hay and W. Dorr
	Legg displayed in simply gathering as a group and then in recruiting
	like-minded men and women to join them. This bravery is especially
	impressive given the routine intimidation and persecution they
	faced, heightened by the passage of the Smith and McCarran Acts and
	exacerbated by the McCarthy witch hunts for leftists and for
	gays.</p>
<p>Among those Mattachine recruited was Isherwood. In his interview,
	Konrad Stevens, a founding Mattachine member, details his invitation
	to Isherwood to join the Mattachine board in spring 1952 in the
	decisive moment of the Dale Jennings trial for entrapment. The
	founders thought that recruiting professionals and artists would
	lend greater gravitas to the fledgling organization in the midst of
	this groundbreaking legal test. Isherwood, however, declines, though
	he would contribute $100 to Jennings’ defense. As James Kepler,
	another key figure, succinctly put it in his interview, when it came
	to this vanguard movement, “Isherwood was living in the back of the
	bus.” While Isherwood’s motives may not yet be clear, his inaction
	during the 1950s and into the 1960s with these groups is.</p>

<h2>Melissa Bradshaw</h2>
<p>My MSA Research Travel Grant allowed me to spend two weeks (August
	5-18) in Harvard University’s Houghton Library, where I worked on an
	edition of Amy Lowell’s selected letters. No representative
	collection of her letters exists, though she was a significant
	figure in twentieth- century American poetry, corresponding with
	virtually all the most prominent poets, editors, and magazine
	publishers of her time.</p>
<p>I initially planned to spend my time at the Houghton selecting,
	scanning, and transcribing enough letters from Lowell to create a
	robust sampling for a manuscript proposal and in order to strengthen
	my grant applications to secure the substantial funding necessary to
	complete this project. Two things happened in between receiving news
	of MSA’s travel award and my arrival in Cambridge, however, that
	changed the work I was able to do there for the better.</p>
<p> First, shortly before my visit I found out that the Houghton had
	recently scanned all correspondence from Lowell. This meant I was
	able to use my time in the archive reading through Lowell’s incoming
	correspondence while I had scans of her outgoing letters open on my
	laptop, allowing me to follow epistolary conversations in real time.
	So in addition to identifying a critical mass of Lowell’s letters
	for my volume, I was also able to spend time scanning letters she
	was responding to. This has been critical to the work I’m doing now,
	as I contextualize and annotate Lowell’s letters.</p>
<p>Second, I received a last-minute research grant from Loyola
	University Chicago’s Office of Research Services. I was able to use
	that grant to pay for my housing in Cambridge, MA entirely. This
	left the funds from MSA to cover meals, airfare from Chicago to
	Boston, as well as airfare and lodging for a quick trip from Boston
	to D.C. where I spent two days working in the Library of Congress,
	working in the papers of Edna St. Vincent Millay, John Hall
	Wheelock, and the Louis Untermeyer-Robert Frost collection to fill
	in gaps in Lowell’s incoming correspondence.</p>
<p>One of the most important results of my research travel this summer
	is that it helped me reconceive the scope and range of my project.
	In addition to a print volume of Amy Lowell’s selected letters, I am
	developing a digital scholarly edition that will cover a broader
	range of letters. To that end, I applied for and received project
	support through Loyola’s Center for Textual Studies and Digital
	Humanities, applied for and received a scholarship from MSA to
	attend the Digital Humanities Summer Institute in Victoria this
	summer, where I will take an immersive course in the Textual
	Encoding Initiative. And finally, because of the work the MSA grant
	allowed me to do this past summer, I am scheduled to teach a
	graduate course in digital humanities Fall 2019 where a group of
	students and I will begin the work of developing and building the
	digital scholarly edition.</p> -->
