<h2><a name="policy" id="policy"></a>MSA Board Policy on
	Affiliation</h2>
<p> The Modernist Studies Association welcomes opportunities to
	cooperate with national or international scholarly organizations
	that have similar missions in the field of modernist studies,
	broadly defined. We encourage the development of a network of
	national/international scholarly associations in the field of
	modernist studies and anticipate that such affiliations will enable
	greater diversity of disciplines and interdisciplines in modernist
	studies as well as greater geographical scope. The purpose of such
	affiliations is to develop a network of associations in modernist
	studies that enhances communication of scholarly and pedagogical
	work; shares information about association activities; makes
	conference announcements and calls for papers available; establishes
	links on web sites and information about membership options,
	listservs, and other social media activity; provides information
	about publication possibilities; facilitates advertisement trades;
	suggests opportunities for collaborative work; and enhances the
	international and interdisciplinary diversity of conferences and
	related activities in modernist studies. <br />
	<br />

	the Modernist Studies Association;<br /> • Be independent,

	organizations will not be given an automatic slot in the MSA
	program.</p>

	sites of MSA and affiliate organizations will provide links to each
	other’s organizations. The MSA Web Master should be provided with
