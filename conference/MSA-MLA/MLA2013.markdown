In 2007, the Modernist Studies Association was officially approved as an Allied Organization of the Modern Language Association, and became thereby eligible to sponsor two sessions at the annual MLA Convention. The MLA requires all presenters to be active members of the Modern Language Association. The MSA invites, but does not require, all presenters to join the Society.
