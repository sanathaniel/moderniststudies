MSA Statement on Conference Access

The MSA is committed to ensuring that all conference registrants will be able to participate in conference events. We ask that all conference attendees give thought to questions of access and work with the conference organizers to create an event that is welcoming to the entire community of participants.

We ask all conference participants to review the <a href="/assets/MSA-Accessible-Presentation-Guide.pdf">Accessible Presentation Guide.</a>

If you would benefit from individual accommodations including, but not limited to, ASL translation, CART services, paper copies of session presentations, or large type documents, please contact the local organizing committees of the annual conference. We ask that all requests be made as soon as possible, and no later than August 1st, to ensure adequate lead time for arrangements to be made. Thank you for working with us to create an atmosphere that is inclusive and open for all registrants.
