<p>The Modernist Studies Association has announced its short list for

	finalists below. The winner will be announced at the MSA conference
	this fall.</p>

		<strong>CO-WINNER: Aglaya Glebova, <em><a
					href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300254037/aleksandr-rodchenko/"
					target="_blank">Aleksandr Rodchenko: Photography in
					the Time of Stalin</a></em> (Yale University Press,
			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Aglaya Glebova’s elegant study of Aleksandr Rodchenko’s “shadow
		oeuvre” has the feel of an instant classic. At once subtle and
		ambitious, the book illuminates an era—that of the first Five
		Year Plans (1928-1938)—in a way that will engage both art
		historians and literary scholars. Through the lens of the single
		artist study, Glebova shows how, despite their origin in
		government propaganda efforts, Rodchenko’s knotty, eclectic
		images fail to correspond to the ideal of the new Soviet
		citizen. Focusing her critical gaze on an aesthetics of
		prolongation and dwelling rather than action, and on the porous
		and provisional, rather than crisis or rupture, Glebova
		defamiliarizes a set of photographic concepts (perspective,
		color, instantaneity, montage) and art historical categories,
		from portraiture and landscape to the photo essay and album.
			<em>Aleksandr Rodchenko: Photography in the Time of
			Stalin</em> reconsiders the relation of art to
		totalitarianism, elucidating a variety of “paths and
		potentialities” beyond mere complicity, and asking how
		photography might “hold open the vicissitudes of a moment.”</p>

		<strong>CO-WINNER: Noreen Masud, <em><a
					href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/stevie-smith-and-the-aphorism-9780192895899"
					target="_blank">Stevie Smith and the Aphorism: Hard
					Language</a></em> (Oxford University Press,
			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>One wouldn’t expect a book tightly focused on a single poet and a
		small form to feel expansive, but this is precisely the case
		with Noreen Masud’s delightful and inventive <em>Stevie Smith
			and the Aphorism: Hard Language</em>. Aphorism, in Masud’s
		astute theorization, offers a “safe form” for dangerous feeling,
		lingering at the “edge of conversation” and accommodating
		“femaleness, queerness, illness, outsiderhood, and
		unhearability.” With its “acrobatics of display and effacement,”
		aphoristic poetry functions as a “self-concealing mode of
		protest.” Each chapter interweaves Smith’s poetry with her
		drawings, exploring various sources of aphoristic contradiction,
		including classics, proverbs, etiquette guides, refrains,
		quotations, fairytales, captions, and fragments. The book wears
		its feminism lightly, dodging the logic of subversion and
		considering the complexity of midcentury women’s writing via
		Smith’s vexed relation to the “appropriate” and her conjunction
		of waste and frugality, significance and dismissibility. One
		need not be versed in Stevie Smith or even in poetry to love
		reading this quirky and surprising book. </p>

		<strong>Doug Battersby, <em><a
					href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/troubling-late-modernism-9780192863331"
					target="_blank">Troubling Late Modernism: Ethics,
					Feeling, and the Novel Form</a></em> (Oxford
			University Press, 2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>Troubling Late Modernism</em> troubled us as critics, in
		challenging and exciting ways. The authors Doug Battersby
		examines look back on the developments of modernist literary
		form—its ability to align readers’ perspectives with characters,
		the deciphering demands it places on readers—and say something
		like: <em>This is a powerful narrative tool—and perhaps an evil
			one?</em> Through dazzlingly precise, detailed, and
		convincing close readings, Battersby examines the ways these
		authors put us as readers in morally compromised—or
		victimized—positions. Nabokov sets up the reader like a victim
		of harassment, made to feel perversely complicit when she
		imputes a sexual meaning to language; Morrison’s novels offer
		“enforced intimacies.” Often merely trying to understand a novel
		seems to require the reader to participate in an eroticizing
		impulse that might be morally monstrous. Battersby refuses to
		accede to the critical tendency to convert erotic descriptions
		of abused women into philosophical problems about the nature of
		language, asking us, instead, to see close reading as an ethical
		practice—indeed, the only practice capable of exposing and doing
		justice to the most intense and disturbing elements of modernist
		form.</p>

		<strong>Preetha Mani, <em><a
					href="https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810144996/the-idea-of-indian-literature/"
					target="_blank">The Idea of Indian Literature:
					Gender, Genre, and Comparative Method</a></em>
			(Northwestern University Press/FlashPoints, 2022) </strong>
	</p>
	<p><em>The Idea of Indian Literature</em> offers an exciting
		approach to both world literature and comparative literature.
		The book advances a new methodology that unhooks national
		literature from language, attending instead to anti-vernacular
		projects of regional and national literature in India. This
		precise and detailed study moves among Hindi, Tamil, and
		Anglophone literature to advance an understanding of world
		literature grounded not in a fixed corpus but, rather, in a
		dynamic method of worlding: responses to shifting understandings
		of literary value, constructions of literary history, and
		emergent understandings of readership. In this expansive
		theorization of modernism, the undertheorized realist short
		story, with its persistent tropes of a feminized modernity,
		emerges as a powerful new site. The author reveals a utopian
		cosmopolitanism that emerges with and through regional and
		national frames, moving beyond critiques of world literature as
		essentially European or Western. Lucid and ambitious, this book
		ends with a provocative coda, “Ten Theses on Indian Literature,”
		which offers fresh insights to scholars of gender, translation,
		global modernisms, postcolonial studies, and the institutional
		turn in literary studies. </p>

		<strong>Autumn Womack, <em><a
					href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo114655831.html"
					target="_blank">The Matter of Black Living: The
					Aesthetic Experiment of Racial Data,
				1880-1930</a></em> (University of Chicago Press,
			2022)</strong>
	</p>
	<p>We’re perhaps a little too quick to tell stories in which the
		idea of data, or of documentation, marks a form of epistemic
		violence imposed on African American life by white outsiders—or
		so Autumn Womack argues, declaring that, by contrast, “data is
		not this book’s antagonist.” Charting a rigorous, artful course
		between two equally unsatisfying extremes—black sociability as
		fundamentally undocumentable in its fugitive quality on the one
		hand; the fantasy of unimpeachably good data on the other—<em>The
		Matter of Black Living</em> demonstrates, via original and compelling
		archival analysis, the ways African American people have seen in
		data a horizon for their own creative practice. Despite the
		pervasiveness of a white documentary gaze, the forms of data
		Womack examines—the social survey, photographs of lynching
		survivors, documentary film—persistently reveal African American
		subjects and artists as analysts and users of documentation
		technology itself, drawing our attention to the ways these
		formats can point our attention to their own limitations. The
		book ends by asking: “how to document the sociality of black
		life?” The history it tells ensures that we understand the
		effort to do so as an integral part of the history of black
		modernist art.</p>

	published in another year will not be eligible for the prize. This
	exclusion applies even if a new edition (paperback or revised, for
	example) was published in the award year.<br />
